## Intro

This is my personal collection of watchr scripts. I hope you like them :-)

## Usage

### one.watchr.rb

Will only run one script at a time. Use this if you want to test a file in isolation before running the whole suite. Very useful if you have a long-running test suite.

### autotest.watchr.rb

Acts similar to autotest. Will run the tests for a single file until all the tests in that file are passing, and then run the whole suite.
